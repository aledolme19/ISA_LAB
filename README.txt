This is the main folder for the first Laboratory of the Integrated System Architecture course.
The first LAB is based on the design and the implementation of a digital filter.

We have one folder here:
- lab1: this is subdivided in:
	- first_version: the first version of the IIR fitler
	- optimized_version: the optmized version of the IIR filter
Then, each of the two folder has been organized almost in the same way, following the directives
of the Laboratories file.
